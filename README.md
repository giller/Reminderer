#Reminderer
##About
This is my first node.js project written for IBM Bluemix. This is my first application written in node and my first time using Bluemix also.

##What it does
Reminderer takes a message from you as well as a date and time and sends you this message.

It uses the Twilio API to make the call. I had to use a call instead of an SMS because I was using a trial account of twilio.

This is written for the bluemix enviroment so running locally will not work.
